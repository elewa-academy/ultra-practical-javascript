# Ultra-Practical JavaScript

Take a breather, this project will be relaxing after Reading Lodash.  You'll get a chance to explore the planning and development process while refreshing your JavaScript basics.

[Practical JavaScript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) is an outstanding video series by [Gordon Zhu](https://github.com/gordonmzhu) that walks you through developing a Todo app for the browser.  He does an exceptional job of organizing and explaining his development process: the app begins with a very basic implementation that he gradually refactors into a full frontend application. Along the way he introduces key JavaScript features and best practices.

In this project you will follow each step of his tutorial, save your code for each step, then organize these steps into a complete deployment repository.  He will have you build your code in Plunkr, something like Codepen.  After each version of his project you will move your code from Plunkr to a new folder on your computer for later use.

Finally, you will refactor his last version into your final version that uses 3-layerd handlers.

## Specifications

Individually you will follow the entire [Practical JavaScript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) tutorial. 
0. Create a new directory where you will store all of your work for this project. Put in a nice README, but that's all for now.
1. For each version:
    1. Follow his videos, rewriting his code on your own (in plunkr is fine).
    2. Create a new folder named after this version in your directory.
    3. Write a nice README to summarize what happened in this step.
    4. Move your code into a new folder on your computer.



Together we will:
0. Create a new empty folder and repository
1. Copy the code from each folder to a new empty branch on your computer
2. Polish a README for this version
3. Merge that branch into master
4. Place a new tag on master to mark the new version
5. Push to GitHub: 
  * Updated master branch
  * The new version tag


The end result will be a repository organized by steps in the tutorial.  For each step you will have:
* A good README
* A branch
* A release
* Your code
